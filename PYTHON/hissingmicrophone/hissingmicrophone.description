#### Hissing Microphone ####

A known problem with some microphones is the “hissing s”. That is, sometimes the sound of the letter s is particularly pronounced; it stands out from the rest of the word in an unpleasant way.

Of particular annoyance are words that contain the letter s twice in a row. Words like amiss, kiss, mississippi and even hiss itself.

#### Input ####

The input contains a single string on a single line. This string consists of only lowercase letters (no spaces) and has between [1;31m1[0m and [1;31m30[0m characters.

#### Output ####

Output a single line. If the input string contains two consecutive occurrences of the letter s, then output hiss. Otherwise, output no hiss.
