#### Quadrant Selection ####

A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in. There are four quadrants, numbered from [1;31m1[0m to [1;31m4[0m, as shown in the diagram below:

For example, the point [1;31mA[0m, which is at coordinates [1;31m(12, 5)[0m lies in quadrant [1;31m1[0m since both its [1;31mx[0m and [1;31my[0m values are positive, and point [1;31mB[0m lies in quadrant 2 since its [1;31mx[0m value is negative and its [1;31my[0m value is positive.

Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be [1;31m0[0m.

#### Input ####

The first line of input contains the integer [1;31mx[0m ([1;31m-1000 \le x \le 1000; x \not= 0[0m). The second line of input contains the integer [1;31my[0m ($-1000 \le y \le 1000; y \not= 0$).

#### Output ####

Output the quadrant number ([1;31m1[0m, [1;31m2[0m, [1;31m3[0m or [1;31m4[0m) for the point [1;31m(x, y)[0m.
